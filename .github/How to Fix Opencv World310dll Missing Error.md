Opencv\_world310.dll is a dynamic link library (DLL) file that contains the core functions of OpenCV, a popular open source computer vision and machine learning library. DLL files are shared by multiple programs and can be loaded into memory when needed. However, sometimes DLL files can get corrupted, deleted, or overwritten by other software, causing errors when programs try to access them.
 
Here are some steps that you can follow to fix opencv\_world310.dll missing error:
 
1. Reinstall the program that is giving you the error. Sometimes, reinstalling the program can restore the missing DLL file or fix any compatibility issues.
2. Download and install the latest version of OpenCV from its official website. Make sure you choose the correct version for your operating system and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). You may also need to update your Visual C++ redistributable packages from Microsoft.
3. Copy the opencv\_world310.dll file from another computer that has the same operating system and architecture as yours. You can find the file in the OpenCV installation folder, usually under C:\opencv\build\x64\vc14\bin or C:\opencv\build\x86\vc14\bin. Paste the file into the same folder on your computer or into the folder where the program that is giving you the error is located.
4. Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files. This tool scans your system files and replaces any damaged or missing ones with a cached copy. To use this tool, you need to open an elevated command prompt and type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter. Wait for the scan to complete and restart your computer if prompted.

If none of these steps work, you may need to contact the developer of the program that is giving you the error or seek professional help.
