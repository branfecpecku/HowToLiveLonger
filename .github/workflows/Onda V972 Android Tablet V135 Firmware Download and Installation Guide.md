Before you proceed, please note that flashing your tablet is solely your responsibility and TechBalloon365 cannot be held responsible for any issues. You should also backup your data before flashing as you may lose unsaved data during the process.
 
## Requirements
 
- An Onda V972 tablet with a serial number starting with V1 (you can check the serial number at the back of your tablet)
- A Windows PC with PhoenixSuit software installed (you can download it from [here](https://androidmtk.com/download-onda-stock-rom))
- A micro USB cable
- The Onda V972 Android Tablet V1.35 Firmware image file (you can download it from [here](https://sway.office.com/S5x7VdSrlJcHM4BN))

## Steps

1. Launch PhoenixSuit on your PC and click on the Firmware button then Image button and locate the .img file on your hard drive corresponding to the firmware you wish to flash.
2. Disconnect the micro USB cable from your tablet and shut it down, either from Android shutdown menu, or by pressing the Power button for about 10 seconds.
3. Press the Home button on the tablet, plug in the micro USB cable on the tablet, while keeping the home button pressed.
4. While keeping the Home button pressed, make short presses (about half a second duration each) on the Power button for about 10 times or until you see a dialog on the Windows machine asking you to format your device.
5. Click Yes to allow format mode (you will lose unsaved data but it is best to choose this option to avoid bugs/issues).
6. Wait for the flashing process to complete. It may take several minutes.
7. Restart your tablet. Your tablet may start configured in Chinese language. To change it to English, go to Tablet settings (look for a gear icon), then look for a red cloud shaped icon just below a lock icon and press it. Then press the first option on the page that appears and then choose English.
